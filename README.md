INTRODUCTION 
A Kenyan entrepreneur has created an online cryptography course and would want to advertise it on her blog. She currently targets audiences originating from various countries. In the past, she ran ads to advertise a related course on the same blog and collected data in the process.

Defining the Question
My work is to identify which factors determine whether a user clicks on an ad or not.

Metric for Success
The project will be considered a success when I am able to identify what makes a user more likely to click on an ad.
